Vim Configuration File
========================

This repository contains my (somewhat opinionated) `init.vim` file.

## Setup (for NeoVim)

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `./setup.sh` to copy files to `~/.config/nvim`
3. Start nvim
4. Run `:PlugInstall`

## Features

* Spaces by default
* Arrow keys disabled (this forces you to get good at `hjkl`)
* Various key mappings to make navigating through window splits and tabs easier
* `:Trim` command to clean up trailing white spaces (optional automatic call to do it on file save)
